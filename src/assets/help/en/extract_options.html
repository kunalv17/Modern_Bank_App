<h3>Extraction options</h3>

<p>If extraction command is invoked inside of archive, while browsing
archive contents, it will unpack files and folders selected in this
archive. If nothing is selected, RAR will automatically select
the entire archive contents.</p>

<p>If extraction is invoked outside of archive, while browsing usual
non-archived files, selected files are considered as archives
and processed with unpacking. If folders are selected, RAR will search
them recursively for files with archive extensions such as
.rar, .zip, etc. and attempt to unpack them too. If nothing is selected,
RAR will automatically select all files with archive extensions
in the current folder.</p>

<p>Options available in this dialog are listed below.</p>

<h4>Destination path</h4>

<p>Name of folder to place extracted files. If this folder does not exist,
it will be created automatically. You can accept the proposed by default
folder name, enter another folder name using a keyboard or press "Browse"
button to browse for destination folder. You can also click on
"Destination path" button to quickly select one of proposed paths from
the list. Details on proposed paths list <a href="extract_proposed_paths.html">
are provided here</a>.</p>

<h4>Ask before overwrite</h4>

<p>Prompts before overwriting an existing file.</p>

<h4>Overwrite without prompt</h4>

<p>Existing files are overwritten without any prompt.</p>

<h4>Skip existing files</h4>

<p>Do not overwrite files which are already exist.</p>

<h4>Keep broken files</h4>

<p>If enabled, RAR will not delete files which are not extracted properly,
for example, when archive is damaged. By default, RAR deletes such files.
You can try to save a part of the information from broken file.</p>

<h4>Do not extract paths</h4>

<p>Ignore archived path information and extract files from root archive
folder and subfolders to the same destination folder.</p>

<h4>Extract archives to subfolders</h4>

<p>This option is available only when multiple archives are unpacked
and disabled for single archive. It places unpacked contents of each archive
to separate subfolder, which name will be generated based on the archive
name.</p>

<h4>Display extracted files</h4>

<p>Display contents of folder with extracted files on successful
completion.</p>

<h4>Save settings</h4>

<p>Set current state of options in this dialog as the new default.
All options except the destination path are saved. "Extract archives to
subfolders" is saved only if you selected multiple archives.
Options saved here are also used in context menu and clipboard extraction
operations.</p>
