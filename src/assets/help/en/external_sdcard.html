<h3>External SD card support</h3>

<p>This topic is related only to removable external SD cards in Android 4.4
devices. Other Android versions do not restrict write to external card.
Internal card is fully writable regardless of Android version.</p>

<p>In Android 4.4 only applications pre-installed by hardware
manufacturer can write to arbitrary folders of external SD card.
Other applications including RAR are allowed to write only to single
application specific folder on external card and limited to read only
access for other external card folders. For RAR such writable external card
folder is "Android/data/com.rarlab.rar". RAR proposes "files" subfolder
of this folder to store archives and files and uses "External SD card home"
name for this folder. Supposing an external SD card is available at
/storage/extSdCard (it varies on different devices), the full name of
such external SD card home will be
/storage/extSdCard/Android/data/com.rarlab.rar/files.</p>

<p>For devices with external SD card and Android 4.4 links to external
SD card root folder (read only) and to external SD card home (writable) are
added to "Favorites" in <a href="navigation_panel.html">navigation panel</a>
after fresh RAR install. Also you may force RAR to create these links
by deleting all favorite items in navigation panel.</p>

<p>Please be aware that when you uninstall RAR or clear RAR data in Android
application manager, contents of external SD card home folder and its
subfolders is removed completely. Copy all important files from this folder
to another location before taking such actions.</p>
