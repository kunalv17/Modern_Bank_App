<h3>Repair archive</h3>

<p>Repair damaged archive. Repairs an opened archive if invoked inside
of archive. Repairs selected archives if invoked outside of archive,
when browsing files.</p>

<p>Only RAR and ZIP archives can be repaired. Source archive is not changed
and result of operation is stored into a new archive, which is named
fixed.arcname.rar, rebuilt.arcname.rar or rebuilt.arcname.zip,
where 'arcname' is the original archive name.</p>

<p>Success of "Repair" operation depends on the archive type and type
and size of damaged area. Chance of successful RAR archive repair
is significantly higher if recovery record was added when creating this
archive. If archive does not contain the recovery record, chances
are lower, especially for solid archives and no repair is possible
for archives with encrypted file names.</p>

<p>If you press or select .rev recovery volume instead of archive
when starting "Repair" command, RAR will attempt to reconstruct
missing RAR volumes using recovery volumes. It is necessary to place
all available .rar and .rev volumes to same folder before starting
reconstruction.</p>
