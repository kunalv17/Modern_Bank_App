<h3>Context menu</h3>

<p>Long press any file list item to display this menu. If nothing
was selected before, pressed item is selected automatically.
If you long press the top file list item and nothing was selected,
all items are selected automatically.</p>

<p>Context menu contains extraction, archiving, new folder, delete,
rename commands and clipboard operations. Extraction is available inside
of archive or if only a single archive is selected. Archiving
and new folder items are available in file mode, but not inside of archive.
"Open as archive" item is displayed for files with non-archive extension
and archive data, such as .apk. By default such files are opened
in associated application, but this command opens them as usual archive.</p>

<p>Using "Copy to clipboard", "Cut" and "Paste" commands it is possible
to copy selected files and folders from one folder to another, add them to
archive and extract them from archive. At least one of source and destination
locations for copy and paste must be a file folder, they cannot be inside of
archives both. "Cut" command supported for usual files and folders, but not
inside of archives.</p>

<p>If you copy a single file or folder to clipboard and then paste it
to its own folder repeatedly, it is copied to a new name, with incremental
counter after the name part. For example, filename.ext will be copied
as filename1.ext, filename2.ext and so on.</p>

<p>RAR uses its own clipboard not shared with other Android applications
for file operations.</p>
