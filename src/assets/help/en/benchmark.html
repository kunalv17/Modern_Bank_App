<h3>Benchmark</h3>

<p>This command allows to compare performance of RAR compression
and decompression on different hardware platforms. Same versions of
WinRAR and Android RAR share basically the same benchmark core code.
Only user interface part of Android benchmark uses Java. CPU intensive
operations are running as native code, so performance of Java virtual
machine is not measured.</p>

<p>First stage of algorithm generates a stream of pseudorandom numbers
with relatively low redundancy, close to RAR performance worst case.
This stream is passed through RAR compression and decompression algorithms.
Decompression output is compared with source data. If any difference
is found, "Errors found: Yes" is reported. Such errors may indicate
hardware problems like unreliable memory. Though, do not expect this
command to replace specialized diagnostic software. Its purpose is
benchmarking, not hardware testing.</p>

<p>Also the command window contains a size of processed data, elapsed time
and compression speed, current and resulting, in kilobytes per second.
Resulting speed is calculated as maximum speed for limited monitoring period
and is not updated once set. Duration of period to determine resulting speed
might be longer for slower hardware.</p>

<p>Benchmark uses multithreaded version of RAR compression and single
threaded implementations of other algorithms, such as decompression
and random number generation. Since compression is the most CPU intensive
here, resulting performance noticeably depends on a number of available
CPU cores. By default, all available cores are used, but if you wish
to see results for single core or limited number of CPU cores,
you can tap on "number of threads" field to restart measurements
with another thread number.</p>

<p>It is not guaranteed that different RAR versions will report
same compression speed values, so if you use this command to compare
performance of different devices, ensure that you run the same RAR
version in all tests.</p>

<p>Benchmark command is never finished automatically, you need to
close it manually. It does not use any permanent storage, all operations
are performed in memory.</p>
