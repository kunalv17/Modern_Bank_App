<h3>Paths</h3>

<h4>Default extraction folder</h4>
<p>Specify a folder which will be proposed by default as destination
for extracted files in extraction dialog and <a href="context_menu.html">
context menu</a>.</p>

<h4>Use default folder</h4>
<p>Defines when to use the default extraction folder. Possible choices
are "Never", "Inside of temporary folder only" and "Always". Entire contents
of Android/data/com.rarlab.rar temporary folder is removed when uninstalling
RAR application and it might lead to data loss if it contains previously
unpacked files. So by default this option is set to "Inside of temporary
folder only" and, if archive is stored in the temporary folder, which may
happen if it was received from another application, RAR automatically
proposes to unpack such archive to default extraction folder outside of
temporary folder.</p>

<h4>Append archive name</h4>
<p>It controls if archive name without extension is appended to destination
path initially proposed in extraction dialog. It does not affect extraction
to folder command in context menu.</p>

<h4>Extraction history</h4>
<p>If enabled, destination paths in extraction dialog are added to history
and can be selected later with "Destination path" button in this dialog.
Paths selected directly from context menu are not added to history
regardless of this option.</p>

<h4>Start-up folder</h4>
<p>Select a folder to display after RAR is started. By default it is
the device storage root folder.</p>
