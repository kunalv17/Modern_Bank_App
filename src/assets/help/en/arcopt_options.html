<h3>Archiving options: Options</h3>

<h4>Test archived files</h4>
<p>Test files after archiving. This option is especially useful if "Delete
files after archiving" is also enabled. In this case files will be deleted
only if the archive had been successfully tested.</p>

<h4>Create separate archives</h4>
<p>Place every selected file and folder to individual archive.
Archive names are generated as selected item name followed by
appropriate archive extension.</p>

<h4>Use BLAKE2 file checksum</h4>
<p>File data integrity in RAR archive is protected by checksums calculated
and stored for every archived file. By default, RAR uses 32 bit length
CRC32 checksum. If this option is on, 256 bit BLAKE2sp is used instead of
CRC32. While CRC32 is reliable enough to detect most of errors, BLAKE2
has even better error detection properties at cost of slower calculation
and slightly larger archive size. This option is available only
for archives in RAR 5.0 format.</p>

<h4>Show archiving time</h4>
<p>Display the dialog containing the total archiving time on
successful completion of archiving operation. Might be useful when
benchmarking different archiving modes.</p>

<h4>Archive name mask</h4>
<p>Append the current date string to an archive name when creating
an archive. Useful for daily backups. The date string is formatted by
the specified mask, which may include following characters:
</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td><b>Y</b></td>
<td>year</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>M</b></td>
<td>month</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>MMM</b>&nbsp;</td>
<td>month as text string (Jan, Feb, etc.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>W</b></td>
<td>a week number (a week starts with Monday)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>A</b></td>
<td>day of week (Monday is 1, Sunday is 7)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>D</b></td>
<td>day of month</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>E</b></td>
<td>day of year</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>H</b></td>
<td>hours</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>M</b></td>
<td>minutes (treated as minutes if encountered after hours)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>I</b></td>
<td>minutes (treated as minutes regardless of hours position)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>S</b></td>
<td>seconds</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>N</b></td>
<td>archive number (numeric value starting from 1).
<br>When archiving, RAR searches for already existing archive with
generated name and if found, increments the archive number until generating
an unused name. 'N' format character is not supported when creating volumes.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Each of format string characters listed above represents only one
character added to archive name. For example, use WW for two digit
week number or YYYY to define the four digit year.</p>

<p>If the first character in the format string is '+', positions of
the date string and base archive name are exchanged, so a date will
precede an archive name.</p>

<p>The format string may contain optional text enclosed in '{' and
'}' characters. This text is inserted into archive name.</p>

<p>All other characters of format string are added to archive name
without changes.</p>
