<h3>Archiving options: General</h3>

<h4>Archive name</h4>
<p>Specify the name of archive to create or update.
You can enter the name manually or press "Browse" button to locate
an existing archive or folder. If archive name extension is not specified,
it will be appended automatically. If path to archive is missing,
the current folder is assumed. "Archive name" label is clickable and switches
between current folder and device storage root folder. In Android 4.4 or newer
"Archive name" also displays external card and USB drive paths if they are
available.</p>

<h4>RAR, ZIP or RAR 4.x</h4>
<p>Select the archive format. RAR option means RAR 5.0 archive format,
which usually provides better compression ratio, data recovery
and encryption options, while ZIP is more widespread and can be unpacked
by a larger number of different software programs. Select RAR 4.x to create
an archive in RAR 4.x format, compatible with WinRAR 4.x versions.
RAR 5.0 format has more efficient recovery record, stronger encryption
and typically higher compression than RAR 4.x. So use RAR 4.x,
only if archive must be unpacked by software lacking RAR 5.0
decompression support.</p>

<h4>Set password</h4>
<p>Encrypt archiving files with a password. For maximum security
it is recommended to use RAR format, which utilizes a stronger encryption
algorithm, to avoid passwords shorter than 8 characters, to avoid common
words as passwords.</p>

<h4>Delete files after archiving</h4>
<p>If archiving has completed successfully, original files will be
deleted.</p>

<h4>Create solid archive</h4>
<p>This option is available only for RAR format and only for new archives.
It is ignored when updating an existing archive. If it is enabled, all files
in archive are handled as one continuous data stream. It helps to improve
the compression ratio, especially for many small similar files.
While creating a new solid archive requires about the same time as 
usual non-solid archive, updating files and extracting individual files
in solid archives is much slower than in non-solid. It is not recommended to
use solid mode if you plan to update an archive in the future. Also solid
archives are more sensitive to data damage. Unlike usual archives, all files
after damaged one most probably will also be damaged.</p>

<h4>Profiles</h4>
<p>This button allows to save current settings from all archiving dialog
pages to profile, to select settings previously stored in profiles
and to organize profiles. You can mark one of profiles as default
in "Organize profiles", so it will be selected automatically when opening
the dialog. Default profile is denoted by a solid circle before its name,
other profiles have an empty circle preceding the profile name
in list of saved profiles. "Save current settings as default" command
saves settings to profile with "Default profile" name and marks it
as the default in single step. Some settings, such as archive name,
password and selected files, are not stored in the profile.
Part of default profile options is also used in context menu
and clipboard archiving operations.</p>
