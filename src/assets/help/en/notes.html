<h3>Notes</h3>

<h4>Temporary files</h4>

<p>RAR may create temporary files when exchanging data with other
applications. Such files are not deleted immediately, because they can
still be in use by another program. RAR will delete them later,
typically when these files become older than one hour.</p>
