<h3>Archiving options: Advanced</h3>

<h4>Compression</h4>
<p>Choose between "Store without compression", "Fastest", "Fast", "Normal",
"Good" and "Best" methods. "Store" writes files to archive at maximum speed
and without compression. For every following method compression ratio becomes
higher and speed lower, when going from "Fastest" to "Best". This is the only
option available for RAR and ZIP archives on the dialog page, other options
are for RAR archives only.</p>

<h4>Dictionary</h4>
<p>Size of memory area to find and compress repeated patterns
in processing data. Larger dictionary may improve the compression ratio
for big files, especially when creating a solid archive.
But larger dictionary also decreases the compression speed
and increases memory requirements. Proposed dictionary size values
depend on free memory amount. You will be able to select larger
dictionary if more memory is available. RAR 4.x maximum dictionary size
is 4 MB.</p>

<h4>Recovery record</h4>
<p>Add the recovery record, which may help "Repair" command to restore
an archive in case of damage. Recovery record size is specified
in percent of archive size. Larger recovery record allows to restore
a larger damaged area, but increases the archive size and needs more time
to create. Usually 3 - 10% of archive size is a reasonable choice.</p>

<h4>Volume size</h4>
<p>It is possible to create an archive consisting of several files.
Such archive is called multivolume and individual files composing this
archive are known as volumes. Here you can specify a size of single volume
in multivolume archive.</p>

<h4>Pause after each volume</h4>
<p>Ask for confirmation before creating every volume. It is safe to change
media with already created volume, when such prompt is displayed.
This option is ignored if volume size is not specified.</p>

<h4>Recovery volumes</h4>
<p>Define a number of recovery volumes for multivolume archive.
When extracting an archive, each recovery volume (.rev extension) allows
to reconstruct one missing usual volume file (.rar extension).
Number of recovery volumes must be less than number of usual RAR volumes
and it is reduced automatically if necessary. This option is ignored
if volume size is not specified. You need to place all available
.rar and .rev volumes to same folder to allow reconstruction of missing
.rar volumes. It is also possible to reconstruct missing volumes
without extraction, just select one of .rev files in the file list
and activate "Repair" command or tap on .rev file name.</p>
